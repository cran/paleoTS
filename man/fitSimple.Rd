Fit simple models of trait evolution

\details{
This is a convenience function that calls the specific individual
functions for each model and parameterization, such as \code{opt.GRW} and
\code{opt.joint.GRW}. The models that this function can fit are:
\itemize{
\item  \strong{GRW}: General Random Walk. Under this model, evolutionary
changes, or "steps" are drawn from a distribution with a mean of \code{mstep}
and variance of \code{vstep}.  \code{mstep} determines directionality and
\code{vstep} determines volatility (Hunt, 2006).
\item  \strong{URW}:
Unbiased Random Walk. Same as GRW with \code{mstep} = 0, and thus evolution
is non-directional. For a URW, \code{vstep} is the rate parameter.
\item \strong{Stasis}: This parameterization follows Sheets & Mitchell (2001), with
a constant mean \code{theta} and variance \code{omega} (equivalent to white
noise).
\item  \strong{Strict Stasis}: Same as Stasis with \code{omega} = 0,
indicating no real evolutionary differences; all observed variation is
sampling error (Hunt et al. 2015).
\item  \strong{OU}: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
model (Hunt et al. 2008). This model is that of a population ascending a
nearby peak in the adaptive landscape. The optimal trait value is \code{theta},
\code{alpha} indicates the strength of attraction to that peak (= strength of
stabilizing selection around \code{theta}), \code{vstep} measures the random walk component (from genetic drift) and \code{anc} is the trait value
at the start of the sequence.
 \item  \strong{ACDC}: Accelerating or decelerating evolution
model (Blomberg et al. 2003). This model is that of a population undergoing a
random walk with a step variance that increases or decreases over time. The initial step variance is \code{vstep0},
and the parameter \code{r} controls its rate of increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) over time.
When \code{r} < 0, the is equivalent to the "Early burst" model of Harmon et al.
\item  \strong{covTrack}: Covariate-tracking (Hunt et al. 2010). The trait tracks
a covariate with slope \code{b1}, consistent with an adaptive response. \code{evar} is the
residual variance, and, under \code{method = "Joint"}, \code{b0} is the intercept of the
relationship between trait and covariate.
model. }
}
\note{
For the covariate-tracking model, z should be a vector of length
\emph{n} when \code{method = "Joint"} and \emph{n} - 1 when \code{method =
"AD"}, where \emph{n} is the number of samples in \code{y}. \cr \cr Method =
\code{"Joint"} is a full likelihood approach, considering each time-series as
a joint sample from a multivariate normal distribution.  Method = \code{"AD"}
is a REML approach that uses the differences between successive samples.
They perform similarly, but the Joint approach does better under some
circumstances (Hunt, 2008).
